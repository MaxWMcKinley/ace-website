# ACE
Website for the Aggie Club of Engineers organization and Texas A&M University.  The website does two things.  First, serves as a basic static website with information about the organization open to the public.  It also has an account and event tracking system that allows officers to create custom events that members can sign up for before attending.  The system tracks the points and attendance of all the members of the organization.
