          <h1>Who Are We?<hr></h1>
          <p>The Aggie Club of Engineers is a social, service, and leadership organization strongly rooted in academics. ACE was founded on the idea that engineers should not only develop strongly in academics but also be of strong character. Our aim is to develop our members as successful Aggies and leaders with an emphasis on academic success and character development while also improving Aggieland as a whole by giving back to the community.</p>

         	<p>&emsp;The Aggie Club of Engineers started with a handful of guys, drinking a handful of beers at O’Bannon’s. They had worked through their first challenging years of engineering all while being involved in some of the best fraternities and professional organizations A&amp;M has to offer. They were, by all stretches of the word, successful. But they had realized one thing. For all the prestige their organizations boasted, they just didn’t bring engineers together inside and outside of the classroom. They needed something different.</p>
					<p>&emsp;7 years later, ACE stands as an homage to our founders’ vision. We have joined the ranks of some of the premier men’s organizations on campus, but with a flavor all our own. We have cultivated a culture that allows our members to develop in academics and leadership, while offering the highest caliber professional opportunities and social events. This is made possible by the amazing diversity in our organization. Our members represent over a dozen countries and come from every engineering discipline at Texas A&amp;M. We have Student Senators, Fish Camp Counselors, Muster Committee members, Executives at fraternities and professional organizations, and members of the Student Engineering Council. Each one of us brings a unique experience and background and puts it toward one common goal: To create a place for leaders to thrive.</p>
					<p>&emsp;Personally, I cannot overstate the impact ACE has had in developing me through college. It has given me friendships and memories that will last the rest of my time on this Earth. Every tailgate and every retreat, every formal and every meeting. Each one has made me better than the day before. To be chosen by my best friends to continue that mission for other young engineers is the single greatest honor of my life.</p>
					<p>&emsp;To be the best, we have to take the best natural born leaders that Dwight Look has to offer. If you think you have what it takes, please check out our recruitment tab above. We’d love to get to know you.</p>
					<p>&emsp;For any questions regarding the organization or if you would like to come speak to our members, please contact me at <a href="mailto:tamuacepresident@gmail.com" target="_blank">tamuacepresident@gmail.com</a>.</p>

					<p>Thanks and Gig ‘em,</p>
